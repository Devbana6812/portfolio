    <h1> Self Introduction</h1>
    Self-introduction is when you introduce yourself to another person or a group of people in a formal interview or a casual meetup at a party.  If someone asks you for a self-introduction, they are asking you to summarise the most relevant information about yourself and your life.  A self-introduction should include important information that is relevant to the context you’re introducing yourself in.  In a job interview, your focus will be on your work achievements, however, at a party, you’re more likely to talk about your hobbies, what you do, and where you live.
